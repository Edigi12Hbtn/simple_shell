.SH NAME
simple_shell - format and print data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B printf FORMAT [ARGUMENT]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell is a function to do formatted printing. This function allows for printing numbers and other things stored in variables.
.B simple_shell takes one argument:a string of characters to be printed. This string is composed of characters, each of which is printed exactly as it appears.
.SH EXAMPLE
The real power of printf is when we are printing the contents of variables. Letâ€™s take the format specifier %d for example. This prints a number. So, a number must be provided for printing. This is done by adding another argument to the printf statement,
as shown here.

    simple_shell ( "I am %d years old\n", age );

In this example, printf has two arguments. The first is a string: "I am %d years old\n". The second is an integer, age.
